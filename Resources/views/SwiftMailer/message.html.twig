Hi there!

{# @var commandStatus \DavidKmenta\CommandSupervisorBundle\Entity\CommandStatus #}
The command "{{ commandStatus.name }}" is not running anymore

{%- if commandStatus.status is null %}
 and the status of the command is UNKNOWN :-(
{%- else %}
, but it should be executed every {{ commandStatus.threshold }} seconds.
Last successful run was detected at {{ commandStatus.lastRun | date('Y-m-d H:i:s') }}.
{%- endif %}


Please, take a look at it!
